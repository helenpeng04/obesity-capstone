## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
table(data_2024$Unreliable...4)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# COUNTY-LEVEL SCATTERPLOTS (Relationship with Obesity)
county_data <- data_2024 |> 
  select(State, County, 
         obesity = `% Adults with Obesity`,
         inactivity = `% Physically Inactive`,
         food_index = `Food Environment Index`) |> 
  filter(!is.na(obesity), !is.na(inactivity), !is.na(food_index))

# Inactivity vs Obesity
inactivity_plot <- ggplot(county_data, aes(x = inactivity, y = obesity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "navy") +
  labs(title = "Physical Inactivity vs Obesity",
       x = "Physical Inactivity Rate (%)",
       y = "Obesity Rate (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Food Index vs Obesity (note: lower index = worse food access)
food_plot <- ggplot(county_data, aes(x = food_index, y = obesity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Food Environment vs Obesity",
       x = "Food Environment Index (Higher = Better Access)",
       y = "Obesity Rate (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine just the scatterplots
combined_scatterplots <- inactivity_plot + food_plot

# Display the combined plot
combined_scatterplots
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
